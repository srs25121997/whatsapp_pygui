# whatsapp_pygui
 Presently We can only send messages to 5 people at a moment. So if we have to send messages to many people it becomes tiresome. Especially if we have to send invitation and we have a long contact list.

Broadcast list are of great use but in this case if the number is not saved in the othger persons's phone the message is not delivered to the person.

In this script I have automated the sending message using python to send messages from contact list.
 
 press S to start the program,
 L if we want to scroll down,
 G if we want to send the invitation to the person.
 
 It auto scrolls to the person last contacted.
 
 PS: Made this automation for a friends wedding and it was very helpful as there were 2000+ contacts.
